Keras based LM framework for neuro-symbolic applications and In-Context learning

# Usage documentation

# Introduction

______________________________________________________________________

## What is Synalinks?

Synalinks is an open-source framework that makes it easy to create, evaluate, train, and deploy industry-standard Language Models (LMs) applications. Synalinks follows the principle of *progressive disclosure of complexity*: meaning that simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced ones should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.

Synalinks is an *adaptation of Keras 3* focused on neuro-symbolic systems and in-context reinforcement learning, an ensemble of techniques that enhance the LMs predictions and accuracy without changing the weights of the model. The goal of Synalinks is to facilitate the rapid setup of simple applications while providing the flexibility for researchers and advanced users to develop sophisticated systems.

You can use the [`llms.txt`](/synalinks/llms.txt) or [`llms-full.txt`](/synalinks/llms-full.txt) to feed your favorite LMs with Synalinks documentation

## Who is Synalinks for?

Synalinks is designed for a diverse range of users, from professionals and AI researchers to students, independent developers, and hobbyists. It is suitable for anyone who wants to learn about AI by building/composing blocks or build solid foundations for enterprise-grade products. While a background in Machine Learning and Deep Learning can be advantageous — as Synalinks leverages design patterns from Keras, one of the most user-friendly and popular Deep Learning frameworks — it is not a prerequisite. Synalinks is designed to be accessible to anyone with programming skills in Python, making it a versatile and inclusive platform for AI development.

## Why use Synalinks?

Developping a successful LM application in a profesional context, beyond stateless chatbots, is difficult and typically include:

- **Building optimized prompts with examples/instructions at each step**: Synalinks uses advanced In-Context Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize each prompt.
- **Pipelines that change over time**: Easily edit your pipelines, re-run your training, and you're good to go.
- **Ensuring the correctness of the LMs output**: Synalinks combines constrained structured output with In-Context RL to ensure both format and content correctness.
- **Async Optimization**: Synalinks automatically optimizes your pipelines by detecting parallel processes.
- **Assessing the performance of your application**: Synalinks provides built-in metrics and rewards to evaluate your workflows.
- **Configuring Language & Embedding Models**: Seamlessly integrate multiple LM providers like Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral or Groq.
- **Documenting your ML workflows**: Plot your workflows, training history, and evaluations; document everything.
- **Versioning the prompts/pipelines**: Each program is serializable into JSON so you can version it with git.
- **Deploying REST APIs**: Compatible out-of-the-box with FastAPI so your Data Scientists and Web Developers can stop tearing each other apart.

Synalinks can help you simplify these tasks by leveraging decade old practices in Deep Learning frameworks. We provide a comprehensive suite of tools and features designed to streamline the development process, making it easier to create, evaluate, train, document and deploy robust neuro-symbolic LMs applications.

        Example:

        ```python
        program.compile(
            optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
            reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(),

            ],
        )
        ```

        Args:
            optimizer (Optimizer): Optimizer instance. See `synalinks.optimizers`.
            reward (Reward): Reward function. A `synalinks.rewards.Reward`
                instance. See `synalinks.rewards`. A reward function is
                any callable with the signature `reward = fn(y_true, y_pred)`,
                where `y_true` are the ground truth values, and `y_pred`
                are the program's predictions.
                `y_true` should be a list of batch size length `[d0, .. dN]`.
                `y_pred` should be a list of batch size length `[d0, .. dN]`.
                The reward function should return a float.
            reward_weights (list): Optional list specifying scalar coefficients
                (Python floats) to weight the reward contributions of
                different program outputs. The reward value that will be maximized
                by the program will then be the *weighted sum* of all individual
                rewards, weighted by the `reward_weights` coefficients. It is
                expected to have a 1:1 mapping to the program's outputs.
            metrics (list): List of metrics to be evaluated by the program during
                training and testing. Each of it is a `synalinks.metrics.Metric`
                instance. See `synalinks.metrics`. A function is any callable with the
                signature `result = fn(y_true, y_pred)`.
            run_eagerly (bool): If `True`, this program's forward pass
                will never be compiled. It is recommended to leave this
                as `False` when training (for best performance),
                and to set it to `True` when debugging.
            steps_per_execution (int): The number of batches to run
                during each a single compiled function call. Running multiple
                batches inside a single compiled function call can
                greatly improve performance on TPUs or small programs with a large
                Python overhead. At most, one full epoch will be run each
                execution. If a number larger than the size of the epoch is
                passed, the execution will be truncated to the size of the
                epoch. Note that if `steps_per_execution` is set to `N`,
                `Callback.on_batch_begin` and `Callback.on_batch_end` methods
                will only be called every `N` batches (i.e. before/after
                each compiled function execution).

        Args:
            x (np.ndarray | generator): Input data. It can be:
                - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of `DataModel` arrays
                    (in case the model has multiple inputs).
                - A list of dict mapping input names to the corresponding `DataModel`s,

                - A Python generator function yielding `(inputs, targets)`.
            y (np.ndarray): Target data. Like the input data `x`, it can be either NumPy
                array(s) of `DataModel`(s). If `x` is a Python generator function,
                `y` should not be specified since targets will be obtained from
                `x`.
            batch_size (int): Integer or `None`.
                Number of samples per batch of computation.
                If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
                Do not specify the `batch_size` if your input data `x` is a
                Python generator function since they generate batches.
            epochs (int): Integer. Number of epochs to train the program.
                An epoch is an iteration over the entire `x` and `y`
                data provided (unless the `steps_per_epoch` flag is set to
                something other than None).
                Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`,
                `epochs` is to be understood as "final epoch".
                The program is not trained for a number of iterations
                given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch
                of index `epochs` is reached.
            verbose (int): `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
                0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.
                "auto" becomes 1 for most cases.
                Note that the progress bar is not
                particularly useful when logged to a file,
                so `verbose=2` is recommended when not running interactively
                (e.g., in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.
            callbacks (list): List of `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` instances.
                List of callbacks to apply during training.
                See `synalinks.callbacks`. Note
                `synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` and
                `synalinks.callbacks.History` callbacks are created
                automatically and need not be passed to `program.fit()`.
                `synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` is created
                or not based on the `verbose` argument in `program.fit()`.
            validation_split (float): Float between 0 and 1.
                Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
                The program will set apart this fraction of the training data,
                will not train on it, and will evaluate the reward and any program
                metrics on this data at the end of each epoch. The validation
                data is selected from the last samples in the `x` and `y` data
                provided, before shuffling.
                This argument is only supported when `x` and `y` are made of
                data_models.
                If both `validation_data` and `validation_split` are provided,
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
            validation_data (tuple | iterator): Data on which to evaluate
                the reward and any program metrics at the end of each epoch.
                The program will not be trained on this data.
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
                It can be:
                - A tuple `(x_val, y_val)` of `DataModel`s lists.
            shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the training data before each
                epoch. This argument is ignored when `x` is a Python generator function.
            initial_epoch (int): Integer.
                Epoch at which to start training
                (useful for resuming a previous training run).
            steps_per_epoch (int): Integer or `None`.
                Total number of steps (batches of samples) before declaring one
                epoch finished and starting the next epoch. When training with
                input data_models arrays, the default `None` means that the
                value used is the number of samples in your dataset divided by
                the batch size, or 1 if that cannot be determined.
                If `x` is a Python generator function, the
                epoch will run until the input dataset is exhausted. When
                passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the
                `steps_per_epoch` argument, otherwise the training will run
                indefinitely.
            validation_steps (int): Integer or `None`.
                Only relevant if `validation_data` is provided.
                Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before
                stopping when performing validation at the end of every epoch.
                If `validation_steps` is `None`, validation will run until the
                `validation_data` dataset is exhausted. In the case of an
                infinitely repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely. If
                `validation_steps` is specified and only part of the dataset
                is consumed, the evaluation will start from the beginning of the
                dataset at each epoch. This ensures that the same validation
                samples are used every time.
            validation_batch_size (int): Integer or `None`.
                Number of samples per validation batch.
                If unspecified, will default to `batch_size`.
                Do not specify the `validation_batch_size` if your data is a
                `synalinks.utils.PyDataset`, `tf.data.Dataset`,
                `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` or Python generator function
                since they generate batches.
            validation_freq (int): Only relevant if validation data is provided.
                Specifies how many training epochs to run
                before a new validation run is performed,
                e.g. `validation_freq=2` runs validation every 2 epochs.

        Returns:
            (History): A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is
                a record of training reward values and metrics values
                at successive epochs, as well as validation reward values
                and validation metrics values (if applicable).

                - A Python generator function yielding `(inputs, targets)`.
            y (np.ndarray): Target data. Like the input data `x`, it can be either NumPy
                array(s) of `DataModel`(s). If `x` is a Python generator function,
                `y` should not be specified since targets will be obtained from
                `x`.

                Number of samples per batch of computation.
                If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
                Do not specify the `batch_size` if your input data `x` is a

                0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line.
                `"auto"` becomes 1 for most cases.
                Note that the progress bar is not
                particularly useful when logged to a file, so `verbose=2` is
                recommended when not running interactively
                (e.g. in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.
            steps (int): Integer or `None`.
                Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before
                declaring the evaluation round finished. If `steps` is `None`,
                it will run until `x` is exhausted. In the case of an infinitely
                repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely.
            callbacks (list): List of `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` instances.
                List of callbacks to apply during evaluation.
            return_dict (bool): If `True`, reward and metric results are returned as a
                dict, with each key being the name of the metric.
                If `False`, they are returned as a list.

        Returns:
            (float | list | dict): Scalar test reward
                (if the program has a single output and no metrics)
                or list of scalars (if the program has multiple outputs
                and/or metrics). The attribute `program.metrics_names` will give you

            callbacks (list): List of `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` instances.
                List of callbacks to apply during prediction.

            (list): `JsonDataModel` array(s) of predictions.

## `evaluate(x=None, y=None, batch_size=32, verbose='auto', steps=None, callbacks=None, return_dict=True, **kwargs)`

Returns the reward value & metrics values for the program in test mode.

Computation is done in batches (see the `batch_size` arg.)

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `ndarray | generator` | Input data. It can be: - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of DataModel arrays (in case the model has multiple inputs). - A list of dict mapping input names to the corresponding DataModels, if the program has named inputs. - A Python generator function yielding (inputs, targets). | `None` |
| `y` | `ndarray` | Target data. Like the input data x, it can be either NumPy array(s) of DataModel(s). If x is a Python generator function, y should not be specified since targets will be obtained from x. | `None` |
| `batch_size` | `int` | Integer or None. Number of samples per batch of computation. If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32. Do not specify the batch_size if your input data x is a Python generator function since they generate batches. | `32` |
| `verbose` | `int | str` | "auto", 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line. "auto" becomes 1 for most cases. Note that the progress bar is not particularly useful when logged to a file, so verbose=2 is recommended when not running interactively (e.g. in a production environment). Defaults to "auto". | `'auto'` |
| `steps` | `int` | Integer or None. Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before declaring the evaluation round finished. If steps is None, it will run until x is exhausted. In the case of an infinitely repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely. | `None` |
| `callbacks` | `list` | List of synalinks.callbacks.Callback instances. List of callbacks to apply during evaluation. | `None` |
| `return_dict` | `bool` | If True, reward and metric results are returned as a dict, with each key being the name of the metric. If False, they are returned as a list. | `True` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `float | list | dict` | Scalar test reward (if the program has a single output and no metrics) or list of scalars (if the program has multiple outputs and/or metrics). The attribute program.metrics_names will give you the display labels for the scalar outputs. |

        array(s) of `DataModel`(s). If `x` is a Python generator function,
        `y` should not be specified since targets will be obtained from
        `x`.
    batch_size (int): Integer or `None`.
        Number of samples per batch of computation.
        If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
        Do not specify the `batch_size` if your input data `x` is a
        Python generator function since they generate batches.
    verbose (int | str): `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
        0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line.
        `"auto"` becomes 1 for most cases.

        Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before
        declaring the evaluation round finished. If `steps` is `None`,
        it will run until `x` is exhausted. In the case of an infinitely
        repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely.
    callbacks (list): List of `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` instances.
        List of callbacks to apply during evaluation.
    return_dict (bool): If `True`, reward and metric results are returned as a
        dict, with each key being the name of the metric.
        If `False`, they are returned as a list.

Returns:
    (float | list | dict): Scalar test reward

## `fit(x=None, y=None, batch_size=1, epochs=1, verbose='auto', callbacks=None, validation_split=0.1, validation_data=None, shuffle=True, initial_epoch=0, steps_per_epoch=None, validation_steps=None, validation_batch_size=32, validation_freq=1)`

Trains the program for a fixed number of epochs (dataset iterations).

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `ndarray | generator` | Input data. It can be: - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of DataModel arrays (in case the model has multiple inputs). - A list of dict mapping input names to the corresponding DataModels, if the program has named inputs. - A Python generator function yielding (inputs, targets). | `None` |
| `y` | `ndarray` | Target data. Like the input data x, it can be either NumPy array(s) of DataModel(s). If x is a Python generator function, y should not be specified since targets will be obtained from x. | `None` |
| `batch_size` | `int` | Integer or None. Number of samples per batch of computation. If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32. Do not specify the batch_size if your input data x is a Python generator function since they generate batches. | `1` |
| `epochs` | `int` | Integer. Number of epochs to train the program. An epoch is an iteration over the entire x and y data provided (unless the steps_per_epoch flag is set to something other than None). Note that in conjunction with initial_epoch, epochs is to be understood as "final epoch". The program is not trained for a number of iterations given by epochs, but merely until the epoch of index epochs is reached. | `1` |
| `verbose` | `int` | "auto", 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch. "auto" becomes 1 for most cases. Note that the progress bar is not particularly useful when logged to a file, so verbose=2 is recommended when not running interactively (e.g., in a production environment). Defaults to "auto". | `'auto'` |
| `callbacks` | `list` | List of synalinks.callbacks.Callback instances. List of callbacks to apply during training. See synalinks.callbacks. Note synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger and synalinks.callbacks.History callbacks are created automatically and need not be passed to program.fit(). synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger is created or not based on the verbose argument in program.fit(). | `None` |
| `validation_split` | `float` | Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data. The program will set apart this fraction of the training data, will not train on it, and will evaluate the reward and any program metrics on this data at the end of each epoch. The validation data is selected from the last samples in the x and y data provided, before shuffling. This argument is only supported when x and y are made of data_models. If both validation_data and validation_split are provided, validation_data will override validation_split. | `0.1` |
| `validation_data` | `tuple | iterator` | Data on which to evaluate the reward and any program metrics at the end of each epoch. The program will not be trained on this data. validation_data will override validation_split. It can be: - A tuple (x_val, y_val) of DataModels lists. | `None` |
| `shuffle` | `bool` | Whether to shuffle the training data before each epoch. This argument is ignored when x is a Python generator function. | `True` |
| `initial_epoch` | `int` | Integer. Epoch at which to start training (useful for resuming a previous training run). | `0` |
| `steps_per_epoch` | `int` | Integer or None. Total number of steps (batches of samples) before declaring one epoch finished and starting the next epoch. When training with input data_models arrays, the default None means that the value used is the number of samples in your dataset divided by the batch size, or 1 if that cannot be determined. If x is a Python generator function, the epoch will run until the input dataset is exhausted. When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the steps_per_epoch argument, otherwise the training will run indefinitely. | `None` |
| `validation_steps` | `int` | Integer or None. Only relevant if validation_data is provided. Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before stopping when performing validation at the end of every epoch. If validation_steps is None, validation will run until the validation_data dataset is exhausted. In the case of an infinitely repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely. If validation_steps is specified and only part of the dataset is consumed, the evaluation will start from the beginning of the dataset at each epoch. This ensures that the same validation samples are used every time. | `None` |
| `validation_batch_size` | `int` | Integer or None. Number of samples per validation batch. If unspecified, will default to batch_size. Do not specify the validation_batch_size if your data is a synalinks.utils.PyDataset, tf.data.Dataset, torch.utils.data.DataLoader or Python generator function since they generate batches. | `32` |
| `validation_freq` | `int` | Only relevant if validation data is provided. Specifies how many training epochs to run before a new validation run is performed, e.g. validation_freq=2 runs validation every 2 epochs. | `1` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `History` | A History object. Its History.history attribute is a record of training reward values and metrics values at successive epochs, as well as validation reward values and validation metrics values (if applicable). |

Args:
    x (np.ndarray | generator): Input data. It can be:
        - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of `DataModel` arrays
            (in case the model has multiple inputs).
        - A list of dict mapping input names to the corresponding `DataModel`s,
            if the program has named inputs.
        - A Python generator function yielding `(inputs, targets)`.
    y (np.ndarray): Target data. Like the input data `x`, it can be either NumPy
        array(s) of `DataModel`(s). If `x` is a Python generator function,
        `y` should not be specified since targets will be obtained from
        `x`.
    batch_size (int): Integer or `None`.
        Number of samples per batch of computation.
        If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
        Do not specify the `batch_size` if your input data `x` is a
        Python generator function since they generate batches.
    epochs (int): Integer. Number of epochs to train the program.
        An epoch is an iteration over the entire `x` and `y`
        data provided (unless the `steps_per_epoch` flag is set to
        something other than None).
        Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`,
        `epochs` is to be understood as "final epoch".
        The program is not trained for a number of iterations
        given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch
        of index `epochs` is reached.
    verbose (int): `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
        0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.
        "auto" becomes 1 for most cases.
        Note that the progress bar is not
        particularly useful when logged to a file,
        so `verbose=2` is recommended when not running interactively
        (e.g., in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.
    callbacks (list): List of `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` instances.
        List of callbacks to apply during training.
        See `synalinks.callbacks`. Note
        `synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` and
        `synalinks.callbacks.History` callbacks are created
        automatically and need not be passed to `program.fit()`.
        `synalinks.callbacks.ProgbarLogger` is created
        or not based on the `verbose` argument in `program.fit()`.
    validation_split (float): Float between 0 and 1.
        Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
        The program will set apart this fraction of the training data,
        will not train on it, and will evaluate the reward and any program
        metrics on this data at the end of each epoch. The validation
        data is selected from the last samples in the `x` and `y` data
        provided, before shuffling.
        This argument is only supported when `x` and `y` are made of
        data_models.
        If both `validation_data` and `validation_split` are provided,
        `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
    validation_data (tuple | iterator): Data on which to evaluate
        the reward and any program metrics at the end of each epoch.
        The program will not be trained on this data.
        `validation_data` will override `validation_split`.
        It can be:
        - A tuple `(x_val, y_val)` of `DataModel`s lists.
    shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the training data before each
        epoch. This argument is ignored when `x` is a Python generator function.
    initial_epoch (int): Integer.
        Epoch at which to start training
        (useful for resuming a previous training run).
    steps_per_epoch (int): Integer or `None`.
        Total number of steps (batches of samples) before declaring one
        epoch finished and starting the next epoch. When training with
        input data_models arrays, the default `None` means that the
        value used is the number of samples in your dataset divided by
        the batch size, or 1 if that cannot be determined.
        If `x` is a Python generator function, the
        epoch will run until the input dataset is exhausted. When
        passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the
        `steps_per_epoch` argument, otherwise the training will run
        indefinitely.
    validation_steps (int): Integer or `None`.
        Only relevant if `validation_data` is provided.
        Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before
        stopping when performing validation at the end of every epoch.
        If `validation_steps` is `None`, validation will run until the
        `validation_data` dataset is exhausted. In the case of an
        infinitely repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely. If
        `validation_steps` is specified and only part of the dataset
        is consumed, the evaluation will start from the beginning of the
        dataset at each epoch. This ensures that the same validation
        samples are used every time.
    validation_batch_size (int): Integer or `None`.
        Number of samples per validation batch.
        If unspecified, will default to `batch_size`.
        Do not specify the `validation_batch_size` if your data is a
        `synalinks.utils.PyDataset`, `tf.data.Dataset`,
        `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` or Python generator function
        since they generate batches.
    validation_freq (int): Only relevant if validation data is provided.
        Specifies how many training epochs to run
        before a new validation run is performed,
        e.g. `validation_freq=2` runs validation every 2 epochs.

Returns:
    (History): A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is
        a record of training reward values and metrics values
        at successive epochs, as well as validation reward values
        and validation metrics values (if applicable).

## `predict(x, batch_size=None, verbose='auto', steps=None, callbacks=None)`

Generates output predictions for the input samples.

Computation is done in batches. This method is designed for batch
processing of large numbers of inputs. It is not intended for use inside
of loops that iterate over your data and process small numbers of inputs
at a time.

For small numbers of inputs that fit in one batch,
directly use `__call__()` for faster execution, e.g.,
`program(x)`, or `program(x, training=False)` if you have modules
that behave differently during inference.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `ndarray | generator` | Input data. It can be: - A NumPy array (or array-like), or a list of DataModel arrays (in case the model has multiple inputs). - A list of dict mapping input names to the corresponding DataModels, if the program has named inputs. - A Python generator function yielding (inputs, targets). | *required* |
| `batch_size` | `int` | Integer or None. Number of samples per batch of computation. If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32. Do not specify the batch_size if your input data x is a synalinks.utils.PyDataset, tf.data.Dataset, torch.utils.data.DataLoader or Python generator function since they generate batches. | `None` |
| `verbose` | `int` | "auto", 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line. "auto" becomes 1 for most cases. Note that the progress bar is not particularly useful when logged to a file, so verbose=2 is recommended when not running interactively (e.g. in a production environment). Defaults to "auto". | `'auto'` |
| `steps` | `int` | Total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw before declaring the prediction round finished. If steps is None, it will run until x is exhausted. In the case of an infinitely repeating dataset, it will run indefinitely. | `None` |
| `callbacks` | `list` | List of synalinks.callbacks.Callback instances. List of callbacks to apply during prediction. | `None` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list` | JsonDataModel array(s) of predictions. If the pipeline failed, a None is added to the predictions. |

# The Program class

Bases: `Trainer`, `Module`

A program grouping modules into an object with training/inference features.

There is four ways to instantiate a `Program`:

### With the "Functional API"

You start from `Input`, you chain modules calls to specify the program's structure, and finally, you create your program from inputs and outputs:

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class AnswerWithThinking(synalinks.DataModel):
    thinking: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="Your step by step thinking process",
    )
    answer: float = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct numerical answer",
    )

async def main():

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    x0 = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)
    x1 = await synalinks.Generator(
        data_model=AnswerWithThinking,
        language_model=language_model,
    )(x0)

    program = synalinks.Program(
        inputs=x0,
        outputs=x1,
        name="chain_of_thought",
        description="Useful to answer in a step by step manner.",
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Note: Only dicts, lists, and tuples of input data models are supported. Nested inputs are not supported (e.g. lists of list or dicts of dict).

### By subclassing the `Program` class

In that case, you should define your modules in `__init__()` and you should implement the program's structure in `call()` .

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class AnswerWithThinking(synalinks.DataModel):
    thinking: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="Your step by step thinking process",
    )
    answer: float = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct numerical answer",
    )

class ChainOfThought(synalinks.Program):
    """Useful to answer in a step by step manner.

    The first line of the docstring is provided as description
    for the program if not provided in the `super().__init__()`.
    In a similar way the name is automatically infered based on
    the class name if not provided.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        language_model=None,
        name=None,
        description=None,
        trainable=True,
    ):
        super().__init__(
            name=name,
            description=description,
            trainable=trainable,
        )
        self.answer = synalinks.Generator(
            data_model=AnswerWithThinking,
            language_model=language_model,
            name="generator_"+self.name,
        )

    async def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        if not inputs:
            return None
        x = await self.answer(inputs, training=training)
        return x

    def get_config(self):
        config = {
            "name": self.name,
            "description": self.description,
            "trainable": self.trainable,
        }
        language_model_config =             {
            "language_model": synalinks.saving.serialize_synalinks_object(
                self.language_model
            )
        }
        return {**config, **language_model_config}

    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, config):
        language_model = synalinks.saving.deserialize_synalinks_object(
            config.pop("language_model")
        )
        return cls(language_model=language_model, **config)

async def main():

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    program = ChainOfThought(
        language_model=language_model,
    )
```

If you subclass `Program`, you can optionally have a `training` argument (boolean) in `call()`, which you can use to specify a different behavior in training and inference.

Once the program is created, you can config the program with rewards and metrics with `program.compile()`, train the program with `program.fit()`, or use the program to do prediction with `program.predict()` or `program()`.

To understand the difference between `program.predict()` or `program()`, read the [FAQ](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/FAQ/#whats-the-difference-between-program-methods-predict-and-__call__).

### Mixing the subclassing and the `Functional` API

This way of programming is recommended to encapsulate your application while providing an easy to use setup. It is the recommended way for most users as it avoid making your program/agents from scratch. In that case, you should implement only the `__init__()` and `build()` methods.

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class AnswerWithThinking(synalinks.DataModel):
    thinking: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="Your step by step thinking process",
    )
    answer: float = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct numerical answer",
    )

async def main():

    class ChainOfThought(synalinks.Program):
        """Useful to answer in a step by step manner."""

        def __init__(
            self,
            language_model=None,
            name=None,
            description=None,
            trainable=True,
        ):
            super().__init__(
                name=name,
                description=description,
                trainable=trainable,
            )

            self.language_model = language_model

        async def build(self, inputs):
            outputs = await synalinks.Generator(
                data_model=AnswerWithThinking,
                language_model=self.language_model,
            )(inputs)

            # Create your program using the functional API
            super().__init__(
                inputs=inputs,
                outputs=outputs,
                name=self.name,
                description=self.description,
                trainable=self.trainable,
            )

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    program = ChainOfThought(
        language_model=language_model,
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This allows you to not have to implement the `call()` and serialization methods (`get_config()` and `from_config()`). The program will be built for any inputs the first time called.

### With the `Sequential` class

In addition, `synalinks.Sequential` is a special case of program where the program is purely a stack of single-input, single-output modules.

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class AnswerWithThinking(synalinks.DataModel):
    thinking: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="Your step by step thinking process",
    )
    answer: float = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct numerical answer",
    )

async def main():

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="ollama/mistral")

    program = synalinks.Sequential(
        [
            synalinks.Input(
                data_model=Query,
            ),
            synalinks.Generator(
                data_model=AnswerWithThinking,
                language_model=language_model,
            ),
        ],
        name="chain_of_thought",
        description="Useful to answer in a step by step manner.",
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## `get_state_tree()`

Retrieves tree-like structure of program variables.

This method allows retrieval of different program variables (trainable, non-trainable, optimizer, and metrics). The variables are returned in a nested dictionary format, where the keys correspond to the variable names and the values are the nested representations of the variables.

Example:

```
program.compile(
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
    reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(),
)
program.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train)

## `set_state_tree(state_tree)`

Assigns values to variables of the program.

This method takes a dictionary of nested variable values, which represents the state tree of the program, and assigns them to the corresponding variables of the program. The dictionary keys represent the variable names (e.g., `'trainable_variables'`, `'optimizer_variables'`), and the values are nested dictionaries containing the variable paths and their corresponding values.

Parameters:

## `FunctionCallingAgent`

Bases: `Module`

A trainable parallel function calling agent.

The agent has 2 different modes:

- Autonomous: It will execute tools as soon as called.
- Non-autonomous: It will return the tool arguments as a ChatMessage.

In *autonomous* mode, the agent accept **any kind of data model input** and perform a final inference to eventually format its final answer if a `data_model` or `schema` is provided.

Example:

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class NumericalFinalAnswer(synalinks.DataModel):
    final_answer: float = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct final numerical answer",
    )

            parentheses, and spaces.
    """
    if not all(char in "0123456789+-*/(). " for char in expression):

    )

    response = await agent(input_query)

    print(response.prettify_json())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Result:

```

        }
    ],
    "final_answer": 153133.0
}
```

In *non-autonomous* mode (also called human in the loop or interactive mode), the user needs to validate/edit the tool arguments and send it back to the agent. In this mode, the agent requires an `ChatMessages` data model as input and output an `ChatMessage` (or `ChatMessages` if `return_inputs_with_trajectory` is true) back to the user. In that case, the agent ignore the `max_iterations` argument, as it will only perform one **step at a time**.

    The agent has 2 different modes:

    - Autonomous: It will execute tools as soon as called.
    - Non-autonomous: It will return the tool arguments as a ChatMessage.

    In *autonomous* mode, the agent accept **any kind of data model input** and perform a final inference to
    eventually format its final answer if a `data_model` or `schema` is provided.

    In *non-autonomous* mode (also called human in the loop or interactive mode), the
    user needs to validate/edit the tool arguments and send it back to the agent. In this
    mode, the agent requires an `ChatMessages` data model as input and output an
    `ChatMessage` (or `ChatMessages` if `return_inputs_with_trajectory` is true)
    back to the user. In that case, the agent ignore the `max_iterations` argument,
    as it will only perform one **step at a time**.

    ```python
    import synalinks
    import asyncio

## `Action`

Bases: `Module`

Use a `LanguageModel` to perform a function call given the input datamodel.

This module use structured output to call a given Python function. This module can be used in agents or traditional workflows seamlessly, it use the input data model to infer the function parameters.

The output of this module contains the inputs infered by the language model as well as the outputs of the function call.

Note: The function **MUST** return a JSON object dict and be asynchronous.

Example:

```

## `GenericAction`

Bases: `DataModel`

A generic action with inputs/outputs

Source code in `synalinks/src/modules/core/action.py`

```
class GenericAction(DataModel):
    """A generic action with inputs/outputs"""

    action: GenericIO = Field(description="An action already performed")
```

## `Branch`

Bases: `Module`

Use a `LanguageModel` to select which module to call based on an arbitrary input, a question and a list of labels.

The selected branch output the data model computed using the inputs and module's branch, while the others output `None`.

Example:

```
import synalinks

        critique: str
        answer: str

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    x0 = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)
    (x1, x2) = await synalinks.Branch(

## `Decision`

Bases: `Module`

Perform a decision on the given input based on a question and a list of labels.

This module dynamically create an `Enum` schema based on the given labels and use it to generate a possible answer using structured output.

This ensure that the LM answer is **always** one of the provided labels.

Example:

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

async def main():

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    x0 = synalinks.Input(data_model=synalinks.ChatMessages)
    x1 = await synalinks.Decision(
        question="What is the danger level of the discussion?",
        labels=["low", "medium", "high"],
        language_model=language_model,
    )(x0)

    program = synalinks.Program(
        inputs=x0,
        outputs=x1,
        name="discussion_danger_assessment",
        description="This program assesses the level of danger in a discussion.",
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can view this module, as performing a single label classification on the input.

## `Identity`

Bases: `Module`

Identity module.

This module should be used as a placeholder when no operation is to be performed. The module just returns its `inputs` argument as output.

This module can be really useful during development process in order to implement the whole program architecture before the individual modules.

It avoid any data models naming issue that you could have by just forwarding the inputs, that way you can implement the general program architecture, validate it and implement the individual modules later.

Example:

```
import synalinks

class MyAwesomeModule(synalinks.Program):

    def __init__(
        name=None,
        description=None,
        trainable=True,
    ):
        super().__init__(
            name=name,
            description=description,
            trainable=trainable,
        )

    async def build(self, inputs):
        outputs = await synalinks.Identity()(inputs)

        super().__init__(
            inputs=inputs,
            outputs=outputs,
            name=self.name,
            description=self.description,
            trainable=self.trainable,
        )
```

## `Input(schema=None, data_model=None, optional=False, name=None)`

Used to instantiate a `SymbolicDataModel`.

A `SymbolicDataModel` is a symbolic data model-like object, which we augment with certain attributes that allow us to build a Synalinks `Program` just by knowing the inputs and outputs of the program (similar to Keras symbolic tensor).

Example:

```
import synalinks

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str

inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)

# You can also create it using a JSON schema like this:

inputs = synalinks.Input(schema=Query.get_schema())

# Or using a symbolic datamodel:

inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query.to_symbolic_data_model())
```

Parameters:

| Name         | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                               | Default |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `schema`     | `dict`      | A Json schema of the data_model. If not provided uses the data_model argument.                                                                            | `None`  |
| `data_model` | `DataModel` | Optional existing data model to wrap into the Input layer. If set, the module will use this data_model rather than creating a new placeholder data model. | `None`  |
| `optional`   | `bool`      | Whether the input is optional or not. An optional input can accept None values.                                                                           | `False` |
| `name`       | `string`    | Optional name string for the module. Should be unique in a program (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.     | `None`  |

Returns:

| Type                | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SymbolicDataModel` | The symbolic data model corresponding to the given data model/schema. |

## `Not`

Bases: `Module`

Not module.

This module should be used as a placeholder when no operation is to be performed and the output should be None.

This module is useful to implement stop conditions when combined with a conditional branch or as placeholder (like the Identity) before implementing guards that leverage the xor operation.

Parameters:

| Name       | Type                | Description                    | Default |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `**kwargs` | `keyword arguments` | The default module's arguments | `{}`    |

## `Embedding`

Bases: `Module`

Extracts and updates the embedding vector of entities.

This module is designed to work with `Entity`, `Relation`, `Entities`, `Relations` or `KnowledgeGraph` data models. It supports to mask the entity fields in order to keep **only one** field to embed per entity.

**Note**: Each entity should have the *same field* to compute the embedding from like a `name` or `description` field using `in_mask`. **Or** every entity should have *only one field left* after masking using `out_mask` argument.

```

    label: Literal["Document"]
    text: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The document content",

async def main():

        text="my document",
    )

    result = await program(doc)

```

If you want to process batch asynchronously use `program.predict()` instead, see the [FAQ](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/FAQ/#whats-the-difference-between-program-methods-predict-and-__call__) to understand the difference between `program()` and `program.predict()`

## `UpdateKnowledge`

Bases: `Module`

Update the given knowledge base.

This module requires an `Entity`, `Relation`, `Entities`, `Relations` or `KnowledgeGraph` data model as input.

This module perform alignment automatically, also called deduplication, by using the similarity search of the knowledge base. This way of performing alignment is more performant than using a linear alignement algorithm as it use the hierarchical small world neighbors (HSWN) algorithm of the knowledge base.

It however needs to have the entities embeded using the `Embedding` module before updating the knwoledge base.

Parameters:

Your task is to retrive entities among the following entity labels: {entity_labels}.

## `TripletRetriever`

Bases: `Module`

Retrieve triplets using a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach.

Unlike the Text2Cypher approach, this retriever is 100% guaranteed to generate a valid Cypher query **every time**.

It doesn't need to have the graph schema in the prompt, thus helping the language models by avoiding prompt confusion, because the nodes and relation labels are enforced dynamically using **constrained structured output** (similar to the `Decision` module).

It works by using the language model to infer the subject, object and relation labels to search for, along with a similarity search field for the object and subject triplets.

These parameters are then used to *programmatically create a valid Cypher query*.

This approach not only ensures the syntactical correctness of the Cypher query but also protects the graph database from Cypher injections that could arise from an adversarial prompt injection.

    """Retrieve triplets using a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach.

    Unlike the Text2Cypher approach, this retriever is 100%
    guaranteed to generate a valid Cypher query **every time**.

    It doesn't need to have the graph schema in the prompt, thus
    helping the language models by avoiding prompt confusion, because
    the nodes and relation labels are enforced dynamically
    using **constrained structured output** (similar to the `Decision` module).

    It works by using the language model to infer the subject, object and
    relation labels to search for, along with a similarity search
    field for the object and subject triplets.

    These parameters are then used to *programmatically create a valid Cypher query*.

    This approach not only ensures the syntactical correctness of the
    Cypher query but also protects the graph database from Cypher
    injections that could arise from an adversarial prompt injection.

This module features a python code as trainable variable, allowing the optimizers to refine the code during the training loop based on iterative feedback and automatic selection of the best script.

This module works **ONLY** with advanced optimizers (**NOT** the `RandomFewShot` optimizer).

The module executes the entire Python script and expects the result to be stored in a variable named 'result' at the end of execution.

Example:

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

default_python_script = \
"""
def transform(inputs):
    # TODO implement the code to transform the input grid into the output grid
    return {"output_grid": inputs.get("input_grid")}

result = transform(inputs)
"""

async def main():
    inputs = synalinks.Input(
        data_model=synalinks.datasets.arcagi.get_input_data_model(),
    )
    outputs = await synalinks.PythonSynthesis(
        data_model=synalinks.datasets.arcagi.get_output_data_model()
        python_script=default_python_script,
        default_return_value={"output_grid": [[]]},
    )(inputs)

    program = synalinks.Program(
        inputs=inputs,
        outputs=outputs,
        name="python_script_synthesis",
        description="A program to solve ARCAGI with python code",
    )
```

        description="The list of steps",
    )
```

## `SequentialPlanSynthesis`

Bases: `Module`

A module that executes a sequential plan of steps.

This module features a sequential plan as a trainable variable, allowing optimizers to refine the plan during the training loop based on iterative feedback.

Basically learning to plan based on iterative feedback and automatic selection of the best plan.

The module executes each step in the plan sequentially, passing the output of each step as input to the next step. The runner is responsible for executing each individual step. The most common runners are usually a `FunctionCallingAgent`, `ChainOfThought` or `Generator` module, but you can use any Module or Program.

This module start by defaut without any plan, so it is equivalent to a single runner call.

This module works **ONLY** with advanced optimizers (**NOT** the `RandomFewShot` optimizer).

**Note**: The inputs are forwarded to the runner each time by concatenating the inputs with the previous steps outputs. So **ensure that the runner doesn't returns the inputs**, use `return_inputs=False` or `return_inputs_with_trajectory=False` when configuring your runner.

Example:

```
import synalinks
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class FinalReport(synalinks.DataModel):
    report: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The final report",
    )

class TaskSummary(synalinks.DataModel):
    summary: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The summary of the executed task",
    )

async def main():
    tools = # ... tools definition (see `FunctionCallingAgent`)

    inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)
    outputs = await synalinks.SequentialPlanSynthesis(
        data_model=FinalReport,

## `SelfCritique`

Bases: `Module`

Useful to critique the given inputs.

This component critique the inputs given and eventually generate an intermediate reward between 0.0 and 1.0.

You can enable or disable the intermediate reward computation by using the `return_reward` flag (default to True).

To have more accurate results, ensure that the inputs are provided along with the output to evaluate using `return_inputs` in your modules.

Example:

```
import synalink
import asyncio

class Query(synalinks.DataModel):
    query: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The user query",
    )

class Answer(synalinks.DataModel):
    answer: str = synalinks.Field(
        description="The correct answer",
    )

async def main():

    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(
        model="ollama/mistral",
    )

    x0 = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)
    x1 = await synalinks.ChainOfThought(
        data_model=Answer,
        language_model=language_model,
        return_inputs=True,
    )(x0)
    x2 = await synalinks.SelfCritique(
        language_model=language_model,

## `CosineSimilarity`

Bases: `RewardFunctionWrapper`

Computes the cosine similarity between `y_true` and `y_pred`.

Formula:

```
reward = (sum(l2_norm(y_true) * l2_norm(y_pred))+1) / 2
```

The formula is similar to the classic cosine similarity used in deep learning, but scaled to [0.0, 1.0] and adjusted to have a reward that tend towards 1.0 if the two objects are similar (and 0.0 otherwise).

Example:

```
program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.CosineSimilarity(
        embedding_model=embedding_model
    )
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
)

## `ProgramAsJudge`

Bases: `Reward`

Wrap a `Program` into a `Reward`.

You can use this to create advanced reward functions that use a Synalinks `Program`. The program should have two inputs and one output.

**Note:** The output data model/schema should have a field named `reward`.

Example:

```
# ... your program declaration

program = synalinks.Program(
    inputs=x0,
    outputs=xn,
)

program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.ProgramAsJudge(program=program)
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
)
```

Parameters:

| Name       | Type      | Description                                             | Default    |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `program`  | `Program` | The reward program to wrap.                             | *required* |
| `name`     | `str`     | Optional. string name of the reward instance.           | `None`     |
| `in_mask`  | `list`    | Optional. list of keys to keep to compute the reward.   | `None`     |
| `out_mask` | `list`    | Optional. list of keys to remove to compute the reward. | `None`     |

## `RewardFunctionWrapper`

Bases: `Reward`

Wrap a stateless function into a `Reward`.

You can use this to quickly build a reward from a function. The function needs to have the signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

Example:

```
def my_reward(y_true, y_pred):
    # ...
    return reward

program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.RewardFunctionWrapper,
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot()
